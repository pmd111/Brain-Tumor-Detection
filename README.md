🧠 Brain Tumor Detection Using Hybrid Transformer-GAN-U-Net Architecture
This project is an advanced AI-powered system for brain tumor detection and classification from MRI scans. It combines the local feature extraction power of U-Net, the global context understanding of Transformers, and data diversity via GAN-based augmentation into a single synergistic pipeline.

🚀 Key Features:
🔬 Classifies tumors into: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, or No Tumor.

🧠 Segments the exact tumor region using a Transformer-enhanced U-Net.

🧪 Uses GANs to generate synthetic MRI images for robust training.

🌐 Full-stack deployment with a Flask backend and web frontend.

📊 Visual + textual output: Displays input image, segmented tumor, and diagnosis in text.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Backend: Flask (Python)

ML/DL Frameworks: PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Model Architecture: Custom U-Net + Transformer + GAN

Deployment: Localhost (can be extended to cloud)

⚡ Just upload an MRI scan, and the system will predict the tumor type (if any) and highlight its exact location.
